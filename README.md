Final Project for CS 340 Introduction to Databaes

Dustin Walkup 
 
This project uses Flask and MySQL to create a backend and database that reperesents the student and falculty database for a ficticious college Faber. 

I learned a ton about databases while working on this project. Implemented the CRUD operations on many different entitys, incluing Many to Many relationships. 

The most satisfying part of this project was writing the queries and seeing them produce the desired results.
